# Beckn in a box
Beckn-In-a-Box (BIAB) is a modular integration framework that allows any network participant to become beckn-enabled quickly by building simple plug and play modules.

A traditional approach to developing beckn-enabled applications involves the participant to study and understand the specifications, define the scope and use cases based on business workflows, implement the protocol APIs and client APIs, and then register on a network. However, this is a process that is time and effort intensive.

To ease the process of developing beckn-enabled applications, Beckn-in-a-box provides a set of modules which can be easily integrated with the participant's applications. The participants will be able to configure the modules they require based on network role, domain, use cases, etc. and receive an output in the form of open-source code, SDKs or a complete deployable application.
